        <p>Jason &amp; Norah Skipper are Missionaries, Pastors, Church planters &amp; Entrepreneurs now based in Nashville, TN.</p>
        <p>In 1996, At the age of 20, Jason obeyed God's calling and took a one year missions trip to Sucre, Bolivia. That one year turned into 15 years of incredible ministry there. After learning the language and culture, Jason met Norah and they married in 1998. That same year they planted the first of half a dozen churches that they have planted throughout their ministry, both in Bolivia and the United States.</p>
        <p>During their time in Bolivia, thousands upon thousands of lives were <em>(and continue to be)</em> transformed by God's infinite grace and power. In the year 2011, Jason, Norah and their 3 children; Erynn, Jordan &amp; Derrick moved back to the USA with the dream of seeing God move here as they had overseas.</p>
        <p>After multiple years of readjusting to life in the US, preparation &amp; pastoring in Murfreesboro, TN and Rome, GA, the Skippers are now once again ready to launch into their biggest project yet. They are preparing to plant a new, life giving church in Middle Tennessee!</p>
