# dwolla-php: PHP Wrapper for Dwolla's API

## Version 

1.6.10

## Requirements
- [PHP](http://www.php.net/)
- [CURL PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)
- [JSON PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)

## Installation

The recommended way to install dwolla-php is [through
composer](http://getcomposer.org). Just create a `composer.json` file and
run the `php composer.phar install` command to install it:

    {
        "require": {
            "dwolla/dwolla-php": "1.6.10"
        }
    }

Alternatively, you can simply include dwolla.php in your PHP code

## Usage
```php
require 'dwolla.php';
$Dwolla = new DwollaRestClient();
$Dwolla->setToken('[OAuth Token Goes Here]');

// Send money to a given Dwolla ID
$transactionId = $Dwolla->send('[PIN]', '812-734-7288', 1.00);
```

## Generating Application Credentials

To acquire an application `key` and `secret` pair, you'll need to [create a new Application on Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/applications/create).  It's free, quick, and easy!

If you'd like to use the API to act only behalf of your own account (i.e. to make payments from your account, check your account balance), you can generate an OAuth token for your account [here](https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token).

## Examples

This repo includes various usage examples, including:

* Authenticating with OAuth [oauth.php]
* Sending money [send.php]
* Fetching account information [accountInfo.php]
* Grabbing a user's contacts [contacts.php]
* Listing a user's funding sources [fundingSources.php]
* Creating offsite gateway sessions [offsiteGateway.php]

Before trying out the examples, you'll need to specify your Application credentials (`key`, `secret`, an OAuth Token for your account, and your account's `PIN` -- see the above section on how to acquire these) in the `_keys.dist.php` file.  Then rename the file to `_keys.php` and you're all set!
